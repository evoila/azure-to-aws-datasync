# Azure Storage Account Backup to S3 with DataSync

This project facilitates the migration of data from Azure Blob and File Storage to Amazon S3 using AWS DataSync. The primary motivation for this project stems from a customer requirement for an additional, secure backup system on a different cloud provider. This enhances data availability and security by ensuring redundancy and preventing any single point of failure.
